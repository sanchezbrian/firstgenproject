    <h3>Grade 9 is an important foundational year. This is when your GPA will start being calculated and depending on what you want/ need at the end of high school, you want to maintain that GPA at a certain number. Your grades here will weigh into your GPA and/or class rank, so you want to work hard. Ultimately, your grades in Grade 9 will not make or break you, but it's still in your best interest to look out for yourself. </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>During Grade 9, you'll have the option to take Regular versus Honours classes (and depending on your school possibly a few AP classes). Why take an honours class instead of a regular class? There are different reasons as to why you would. For starters, do you want to challenge yourself or are you interested in staying in your comfort zone? </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>You don't need to be too involved in your first year. It's just important that you stay focused in school, and start developing good study habits.</h3>
